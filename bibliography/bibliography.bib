  abstract = {The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) undergoes substantial changes in its structure and dynamics in the course of a day due to the transient nature of forcing factors such as the surface fluxes of heat and momentum. The non-stationary nature of the mean wind and turbulence in the ABL, associated with the diurnal cycle, can in turn affect the structure of wind turbine wakes and their effects on power losses within wind farms. In this research, large-eddy simulation is used to study the evolution of the turbine wakes and their effects on power losses inside an idealised finite-size wind farm in the course of a full diurnal cycle. The simulation results show a strong effect of atmospheric stability on the wind farm wakes and associated power losses. During the day, the positive buoyancy flux and associated turbulence production lead to a relatively high turbulence level in the background ABL flow, which enhances turbulent mixing and wake recovery. In contrast, during the night, the relatively low turbulence intensity of the ambient ABL flow results in a relatively slow rate of entrainment of momentum into the wake and, consequently, a slow wake recovery. As a result, the averaged power deficit in the wind farm is found to increase with increasing thermal stability. In particular, the averaged power deficit increased from 28\% under the most convective condition to about 57\% under the most stable condition. It is also found that the low-level jet formed before dawn is weakened owing to the energy extraction by the turbines and deflected upward over the farm. In addition, strong vertical wind veer at that time, associated with the Coriolis force and shallow boundary layer, causes important lateral wake stretching effects, which in turn significantly impacts the performance of the waked turbines.},

However, additional dynamics and structural loads may result when the floating platform is being excited by wind and waves. In this work, the conventional wind turbine controller is complemented with a novel linear feedforward controller based on wave measurements. The objective of the feedforward controller is to attenuate rotor speed variations caused by wave forcing. To design this controller, a linear model is developed that describes the system response to incident waves. The performance of the feedback-feedforward controller is assessed by a high-fidelity numerical tool using the DTU 10MW turbine and the INNWIND.EU TripleSpar platform as references. Simulations in the presence of irregular waves and turbulent wind show that the feedforward controller effectively compensates the wave-induced rotor oscillations. The novel controller is able to reduce the rotor speed variance by 26\%. As a result, the remaining rotor speed variance is only 4\% higher compared to operation in still water.},

Properly coordinating turbines, by operating some turbines suboptimally, within a wind farm has the potential to improve overall wind farm performance. Computing the optimal control strategy under varying atmospheric conditions can be computationally intense for large wind farms. As wind power farms increase in size and related models become more complex, computationally efficient algorithms are needed to perform real-time optimization and control. This study proposes a distributed optimization framework and computationally efficient wake steering wind farm control strategy that uses the yaw angle of a turbine to alter the behavior of a turbine wake and minimize turbine interactions. This computational efficiency allows the strategy to be feasible for real-time control.},

GPU-accelerated implementations of the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) have shown to provide significant performance gains over classical Navier-Stokes-based computational fluid dynamics.

The numerical sensitivity of the method in a simple uniform inflow is investigated with respect to spatial and temporal resolution as well as the width of the actuator line’s regularisation kernel. Comparable accuracy and slightly better stability properties are shown in relation to a standard Navier-Stokes implementation. The results indicate the overall suitability of the cumulant LBM for wind turbine wake simulations. The potential of the LBM for future wind energy applications is clarified by means of a brief comparison of computational performance.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The high computational demand of large-eddy simulations (LESs) remains the biggest obstacle for a wider applicability of the method in the field of wind energy. Recent progress of GPU-based (graphics processing unit) lattice Boltzmann frameworks provides significant performance gains alleviating such constraints. The presented work investigates the potential of LES of wind turbine wakes using the cumulant lattice Boltzmann method (CLBM). The wind turbine is represented by the actuator line model (ALM). The implementation is validated and discussed by means of a code-to-code comparison to an established finite-volume Navier–Stokes solver. To this end, the ALM is subjected to both laminar and turbulent inflow while a standard Smagorinsky sub-grid-scale model is employed in the two numerical approaches. The resulting wake characteristics are discussed in terms of the first- and second-order statistics as well the spectra of the turbulence kinetic energy. The near-wake characteristics in laminar inflow are shown to match closely with differences of less than 3\&thinsp;\% in the wake deficit. Larger discrepancies are found in the far wake and relate to differences in the point of the laminar-turbulent transition of the wake. In line with other studies, these differences can be attributed to the different orders of accuracy of the two methods. Consistently better agreement is found in turbulent inflow due to the lower impact of the numerical scheme on the wake transition. In summary, the study outlines the feasibility of wind turbine simulations using the CLBM and further validates the presented set-up. Furthermore, it highlights the computational potential of GPU-based LBM implementations for wind energy applications. For the presented cases, near-real-time performance was achieved using a single, off-the-shelf GPU on a local workstation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {An optimal feedback controller for a given Markov decision process (MDP) can in principle be synthesized by value or policy iteration. However, if the system dynamics and the reward function are unknown, a learning agent must discover an optimal controller via direct interaction with the environment. Such interactive data gathering commonly leads to divergence towards dangerous or uninformative regions of the state space unless additional regularization measures are taken. Prior works proposed bounding the information loss measured by the Kullback\&ndash;Leibler (KL) divergence at every policy improvement step to eliminate instability in the learning dynamics. In this paper, we consider a broader family of f-divergences, and more concretely    \&alpha;   -divergences, which inherit the beneficial property of providing the policy improvement step in closed form at the same time yielding a corresponding dual objective for policy evaluation. Such entropic proximal policy optimization view gives a unified perspective on compatible actor-critic architectures. In particular, common least-squares value function estimation coupled with advantage-weighted maximum likelihood policy improvement is shown to correspond to the Pearson     \&chi; 2    -divergence penalty. Other actor-critic pairs arise for various choices of the penalty-generating function f. On a concrete instantiation of our framework with the    \&alpha;   -divergence, we carry out asymptotic analysis of the solutions for different values of    \&alpha;    and demonstrate the effects of the divergence function choice on common standard reinforcement learning problems.},

  abstract = {Instabilities arise in a number of flow configurations. One such manifestation is the development of interfacial waves in multiphase flows, such as those observed in the falling liquid film problem. Controlling the development of such instabilities is a problem of both academic interest and industrial interest. However, this has proven challenging in most cases due to the strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the underlying equations. In the present work, we successfully apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for the control of the one-dimensional depth-integrated falling liquid film. In addition, we introduce for the first time translational invariance in the architecture of the DRL agent, and we exploit locality of the control problem to define a dense reward function. This allows us to both speed up learning considerably and easily control an arbitrary large number of jets and overcome the curse of dimensionality on the control output size that would take place using a naïve approach. This illustrates the importance of the architecture of the agent for successful DRL control, and we believe this will be an important element in the effective application of DRL to large two-dimensional or three-dimensional systems featuring translational, axisymmetric, or other invariance.},

  abstract = {The control of complex systems is of critical importance in many branches of science, engineering, and industry. Controlling an unsteady fluid flow is particularly important, as flow control is a key enabler for technologies in energy (e.g., wind, tidal, and combustion), transportation (e.g., planes, trains, and automobiles), security (e.g., tracking airborne contamination), and health (e.g., artificial hearts and artificial respiration). However, the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics make real-time feedback control infeasible. Fortunately, these high-dimensional systems exhibit dominant, low-dimensional patterns of activity that can be exploited for effective control in the sense that knowledge of the entire state of a system is not required. Advances in machine learning have the potential to revolutionize flow control given its ability to extract principled, low-rank feature spaces characterizing such complex systems. We present a novel deep learning model predictive control (DeepMPC) framework that exploits low-rank features of the flow in order to achieve considerable improvements to control performance. Instead of predicting the entire fluid state, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately predict the control relevant quantities of the system. The RNN is then embedded into a MPC framework to construct a feedback loop, and incoming sensor data is used to perform online updates to improve prediction accuracy. The results are validated using varying fluid flow examples of increasing complexity.},

  abstract = {Wind turbines are often sited together in wind farms as it is economically advantageous. However, the wake inevitably created by every turbine will lead to a time-varying interaction between the individual turbines. Common practice in industry has been to control turbines individually and ignore this interaction while optimizing the power and loads of the individual turbines. However, turbines that are in a wake experience reduced wind speed and increased turbulence, leading to a reduced energy extraction and increased dynamic mechanical loads on the turbine, respectively. Neglecting the dynamic interaction between turbines in control will therefore lead to suboptimal behaviour of the total wind farm. Therefore, wind farm control has been receiving an increasing amount of attention over the past years, with the focus on increasing the total power production and reducing the dynamic loading on the turbines. In this paper, wind farm control-oriented modeling and control concepts are explained. In addition, recent developments and literature are discussed and categorized. This paper can serve as a source of background information and provides many references regarding control-oriented modeling and control of wind farms.},

Adaptation strategies prepare a community to be resilient in the face of unavoidable climate change impacts. Climate impacts—­such as extreme heat events, sea-level rise, changes in precipitation patterns, ocean acidification, and altered wind and storm patterns—­can have a variety of secondary impacts on community conditions ranging from human health and safety to economics to ecosystem integrity. Developing strategies to address these impacts relies on the development of a vulnerability assessment that not only provides an assessment of the projected impacts for a specific community but also includes an evaluation of how the impacts may affect the community and how ready a community is to address them.

We review in a selective way the recent research on the interface between machine learning and physical sciences. This includes conceptual developments in machine learning (ML) motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross-fertilization between the two fields. After giving basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, we describe examples of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML. We then move to describe applications of ML methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. We also highlight research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating ML. In each of the sections we describe recent successes as well as domain-specific methodology and challenges.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of the flow past an array of three aligned turbines have been performed. The study is focused on below rated (Region 2) wind speeds. The turbines are controlled through the generator torque gain, as usually done in Region 2. Two operating strategies are considered: (i) preset individual optimum torque gain based on a model for the power coefficient (baseline case) and (ii) real-time optimization of torque gain for maximizing each individual turbine power capture during operation. The real-time optimization is carried out through a model-free approach, namely, extremum-seeking control. It is shown that ESC is capable of increasing the power production of the array by 6.5\% relative to the baseline case. The extremum-seeking control reduces the torque gain of the downstream turbines, thus increasing the angular speed of the blades. This results in improved aerodynamics near the tip of the blade that is the portion contributing mostly to the torque and power. In addition, an increase in angular speed leads to a larger entrainment in the wake, which also contributes to provide additional available power downstream. It is also shown that the tip speed ratio may not be a reliable performance indicator when the turbines are in waked conditions. This may be a concern when using optimal parameter settings, determined from isolated turbine models, in applications with waked turbines. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Large Eddy Simulations of the turbulent flow over an array of wind turbines have been performed to evaluate a model-free approach to power optimization. Two different implementations have been tested: (i) individual extremum-seeking control (IESC), which optimizes the power of the single turbines individually; (ii) nested ESC (NESC), which coordinates the single controllers to seek a farm-level optimum. Both schemes provide a gain over the baseline, which operates all the turbines with ideal design set-points. These settings are found to be sub-optimal for waked turbines. The NESC provides a slightly larger power production than the independent ESC, albeit it has a slower convergence to the optimum. Therefore, depending on wind variability, both strategies may be employed. IESC is more appropriate for sites with wind conditions changing on a short time scale, while NESC should be preferred when the wind conditions are quite stable. Since the extremum-seeking algorithm is model-free, uncertainties in atmospheric conditions, aging of the turbine or numerical dissipation due to the sub-grid model should not change the general conclusions reached in this paper. This methodology can provide reliable results and permits to gain, through the analysis, a useful knowledge on the mechanisms leading to the performance enhancement.},

  abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is known to suffer from stability issues when the collision model relies on the BGK approximation, especially in the zero viscosity limit and for non-vanishing Mach numbers. To tackle this problem, two kinds of solutions were proposed in the literature. They consist in changing either the numerical discretization (finite-volume, finite-difference, spectral-element, etc) of the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation (DVBE), or the collision model. In this work, the latter solution is investigated in details. More precisely, we propose a comprehensive comparison of (static relaxation time based) collision models, in terms of stability, and with preliminary results on their accuracy, for the simulation of isothermal high-Reynolds number flows in the (weakly) compressible regime. It starts by investigating the possible impact of collision models on the macroscopic behavior of stream-and-collide based D2Q9-LBMs, which clarifies the exact physical properties of collision models on LBMs. It is followed by extensive linear and numerical stability analyses, supplemented with an accuracy study based on the transport of vortical structures over long distances. In order to draw conclusions as general as possible, the most common moment spaces (raw, central, Hermite, central Hermite and cumulant), as well as regularized approaches, are considered for the comparative studies. LBMs based on dynamic collision mechanisms (entropic collision, subgrid scale models, explicit filtering, etc) are also briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Wind farm (WF) controllers adjust the control settings of individual turbines to enhance the total performance of a wind farm. Most WF controllers proposed in the literature assume a time-invariant inflow, whereas important quantities such as the wind direction and speed continuously change over time in reality. Furthermore, properties of the inflow are often assumed known, which is a fundamentally compromising assumption to make. This paper presents a novel, closed-loop WF controller that continuously estimates the inflow and maximizes the energy yield of the farm through yaw-based wake steering. The controller is tested in a high-fidelity simulation of a 6-turbine wind farm. The WF controller is stress-tested by subjecting it to strongly-time-varying inflow conditions over 5000~s of simulation. A time-averaged improvement in energy yield of 1.4\% is achieved compared to a baseline, greedy controller. Moreover, the instantaneous energy gain is up to 11\% for wake-loss-heavy situations. Note that this is the first closed-loop and model-based WF controller tested for time-varying inflow conditions (i.e., where the mean wind direction and wind speed change over time) at such fidelity. This solidifies the WF controller as the first realistic closed-loop control solution for yaw-based wake steering.},

  abstract = {Abstract Wind farm control using dynamic concepts is a research topic that is receiving an increasing amount of interest. The main concept of this approach is that dynamic variations of the wind turbine control settings lead to higher wake turbulence, and subsequently faster wake recovery due to increased mixing. As a result, downstream turbines experience higher wind speeds, thus increasing their energy capture. In dynamic induction control (DIC), the magnitude of the thrust force of an upstream turbine is varied. Although very effective, this approach also leads to increased power and thrust variations, negatively impacting energy quality and fatigue loading. In this paper, a novel approach for the dynamic control of wind turbines in a wind farm is proposed: using individual pitch control, the fixed-frame tilt and yaw moments on the turbine are varied, thus dynamically manipulating the wake. This strategy is named the helix approach because the resulting wake has a helical shape. Large eddy simulations of a two-turbine wind farm show that this approach leads to enhanced wake mixing with minimal power and thrust variations.},

  abstract = {Abstract. As wind turbines in a wind farm interact with each other, a control problem arises that has been extensively studied in the literature: how can we optimize the power production of a wind farm as a whole? A traditional approach to this problem is called induction control, in which the power capture of an upstream turbine is lowered for the benefit of downstream machines. In recent simulation studies, an alternative approach, where the induction factor is varied over time, has shown promising results. In this paper, the potential of this dynamic induction control~(DIC) approach is further investigated. Only periodic variations, where the input is a sinusoid, are studied. A proof of concept for this periodic DIC approach will be given by the execution of scaled wind tunnel experiments, showing for the first time that this approach can yield power gains in real-world wind farms. Furthermore, the effects on the damage equivalent loads~(DEL) of the turbine are evaluated in a simulation environment. These indicate that the increase in DEL on the excited turbine is limited.},

In addition, we present recent results that further illustrate the potential of DRL in Fluid Mechanics. The coupling methods used in each case are covered, detailing their advantages and limitations. Our review also focuses on the comparison with classical methods for optimal control and optimization. Finally, several test cases are described that illustrate recent progress made in this field.

  abstract = {This work develops a deep reinforcement learning based approach for Six Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) planetary powered descent and landing. Future Mars missions will require advanced guidance, navigation, and control algorithms for the powered descent phase to target specific surface locations and achieve pinpoint accuracy (landing error ellipse {$<$}5~m radius). This requires both a navigation system capable of estimating the lander’s state in real-time and a guidance and control system that can map the estimated lander state to a commanded thrust for each lander engine. In this paper, we present a novel integrated guidance and control algorithm designed by applying the principles of reinforcement learning theory. The latter is used to learn a policy mapping the lander’s estimated state directly to a commanded thrust for each engine, resulting in accurate and almost fuel-optimal trajectories over a realistic deployment ellipse. Specifically, we use proximal policy optimization, a policy gradient method, to learn the policy. Another contribution of this paper is the use of different discount rates for terminal and shaping rewards, which significantly enhances optimization performance. We present simulation results demonstrating the guidance and control system’s performance in a 6-DOF simulation environment and demonstrate robustness to noise and system parameter uncertainty.},

The optimization controller is based on a novel internal parametric model for wake effects called the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady-state (FLORIS) model. The FLORIS model predicts the steady-state wake locations and the effective flow velocities at each turbine, and the resulting turbine electrical energy production levels, as a function of the axial induction and the yaw angle of the different rotors. The FLORIS model has a limited number of parameters that are estimated based on turbine electrical power production data. In high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of a small wind plant, we demonstrate that the optimization control based on the FLORIS model increases the energy production of the wind plant, with a reduction of loads on the turbines as an additional effect.

  abstract = {The paper reports on the predictive performance of Lattice Boltzmann methods in turbulent channel flows. Attention is confined to model-free (direct) numerical simulations at Reτ=180 using essentially different collision models, i.e. the Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook (BGK), the Multiple-Relaxation-Time (MRT) and the Cumulant model. The three approaches are assessed by a comparison of the predicted mean flow and turbulence statistics against benchmark Navier–Stokes solutions. Initial studies employ a fine isotropic grid which resolves all relevant scales. Subsequently, a sequence of four gradually decreasing resolutions is utilized to analyze the sensitivity of the collision models for an inadequate resolution. Moreover, the influence of the Mach number and the discretization on the predictive accuracy of the weakly compressible LBM framework is briefly addressed. Whilst the Mach number influence is negligible below Ma {$<$} 0.1, and the predictive agreement with reference data is generally satisfactory in conjunction with all employed discretizations for the fine grid, significant disparities between the collision models are observed when the mesh is coarsened. The BGK approach offers an improved predictive agreement with Navier–Stokes results for an adequate resolution, which comes at the expense of severe (formerly reported) stability issues that emanate from the interface between the buffer and the log-layer for an under-resolved flow. Both the MRT and the Cumulant model are more demanding with respect to grid convergence. As opposed to the BGK and the MRT model, the Cumulant model remains stable over a wide range of resolutions. The reason can be attributed to a rigid alignment between predicted streamwise two-point correlation lengths and the grid spacing, which augments the damping of sub-grid scales. The latter is deemed to be an inherent feature of the model.},

All models offer too few degrees of freedom to impose the conditions on the cumulants directly. However, the specific aliasing structure of these lattices permit fourth order accuracy for a model specific optimal reference temperature.

sentence selection, and sentence topic prediction. Results from experiments run
on two corpora, English documents in Wikipedia and a subset of articles from a
recent snapshot of English Google News, indicate that using both words and
topics as features improves performance of the CLSTM models over baseline LSTM
models for these tasks. For example on the next sentence selection task, we get
relative accuracy improvements of 21\% for the Wikipedia dataset and 18\% for the
Google News dataset. This clearly demonstrates the significant benefit of using
context appropriately in natural language (NL) tasks. This has implications for
a wide variety of NL applications like question answering, sentence completion,
paraphrase generation, and next utterance prediction in dialog systems.},

  abstract = {In very large wind farms, the vertical interaction with the atmospheric boundary layer plays an important role, i.e.~the total energy extraction is governed by the vertical transport of kinetic energy from higher regions in the boundary layer towards the turbine level. In the current study, we investigate optimal control of wind-farm boundary layers, considering the individual wind turbines as flow actuators, whose energy extraction can be dynamically regulated in time so as to optimally influence the flow field and the vertical energy transport. To this end, we use large-eddy simulations of a fully developed pressure-driven wind-farm boundary layer in a receding-horizon optimal control framework. For the optimization of the wind-turbine controls, a conjugate-gradient optimization method is used in combination with adjoint large-eddy simulations for the determination of the gradients of the cost functional. In a first control study, wind-farm energy extraction is optimized in an aligned wind farm. Results are accumulated over one hour of operation. We find that the energy extraction is increased by 16~\% compared to the uncontrolled reference. This is directly related to an increase of the vertical fluxes of energy towards the wind turbines, and vertical shear stresses increase considerably. A further analysis, decomposing the total stresses into dispersive and Reynolds stresses, shows that the dispersive stresses increase drastically, and that the Reynolds stresses decrease on average, but increase in the wake region, leading to better wake recovery. We further observe also that turbulent dissipation levels in the boundary layer increase, and overall the outer layer of the boundary layer enters into a transient decelerating regime, while the inner layer and the turbine region attain a new statistically steady equilibrium within approximately one wind-farm through-flow time. Two additional optimal control cases study penalization of turbulent dissipation. For the current wind-farm geometry, it is found that the ratio between wind-farm energy extraction and turbulent boundary-layer dissipation remains roughly around 70~\%, but can be slightly increased by a few per cent by penalizing the dissipation in the optimization objective. For a pressure-driven boundary layer in equilibrium, we estimate that such a shift can lead to an increase in wind-farm energy extraction of~6~\%.},

The individual wind turbines are considered as flow actuators, and their energy extraction is dynamically regulated in time, so as to optimally influence the flow field. We extend earlier work on wind farm optimal control in the fully-developed regime (Goit and Meyers 2015, J. Fluid Mech. 768, 5–50) to a ‘finite’ wind farm case, in which entrance effects play an important role. For the optimal control, a receding horizon framework is employed in which turbine thrust coefficients are optimized in time and per turbine. Optimization is performed with a conjugate gradient method, where gradients of the cost functional are obtained using adjoint large eddy simulations. Overall, the energy extraction is increased 7\% by the optimal control. This increase in energy extraction is related to faster wake recovery throughout the farm. For the first row of turbines, the optimal control increases turbulence levels and Reynolds stresses in the wake, leading to better wake mixing and an inflow velocity for the second row that is significantly higher than in the uncontrolled case. For downstream rows, the optimal control mainly enhances the sideways mean transport of momentum. This is different from earlier observations by Goit and Meyers (2015) in the fully-developed regime, where mainly vertical transport was enhanced.},

The paper examines the atmospheric conditions from satellite images, radiosondes, lidar and wind turbine data and compares the observations to results from atmospheric meso-scale modelling and large eddy simulation. Key findings are that a humid and warm air mass was advected from the southwest over cold sea and the dew-point temperature was such that cold-water advection fog formed in a shallow layer. The flow was stably stratified and the freestream wind speed was 13 m/s at hub height, which means that most turbines produced at or near rated power. The wind direction was southwesterly and long, narrow wakes persisted several rotor diameters downwind of the wind turbines. Eventually mixing of warm air from aloft dispersed the fog in the far wake region of the wind farm.},

The surrogates, based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), are built using high-fidelity flow simulations coupled with aeroelastic simulations of the turbine performance and loads. Developing a model for wind farm control is a challenging control problem due to the time-varying dynamics of the wake. The wind farm control strategy is optimized for both the power output and the loading of the turbines. The optimization performed using two Vestas V27 turbines in a row for a specific atmospheric condition suggests that a power gain of almost 3\emph{\%}±1\emph{\%} can be achieved at close spacing by yawing the upstream turbine more than 15\textsuperscript{∘}. At larger spacing the optimization shows that yawing is not beneficial as the optimization reverts to normal operation. Furthermore, it was also identified that a reduction in the equivalent loads was obtained at the cost of power production. The total power gains are discussed in relation to the associated model errors and the uncertainty of the surrogate models used in the optimization, as well as the implications for wind farm control.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In addition to reviewing 2019 energy and CO2 emissions data by fuel and country, for this section of the Global Energy Review we have tracked energy use by country and fuel over the past three months and in some cases – such as electricity – in real time. Some tracking will continue on a weekly basis. The uncertainty surrounding public health, the economy and hence energy over the rest of 2020 is unprecedented. This analysis therefore not only charts a possible path for energy use and CO2 emissions in 2020 but also highlights the many factors that could lead to differing outcomes. We draw key lessons on how to navigate this once-in-a-century crisis.},

All simulations were performed with the academic research code ELBE (efficient lattice boltzmann environment, http://www.tuhh.de/elbe). The ELBE code follows the supercomputing-on-the-desktop paradigm and is especially designed for local supercomputing, without tedious accesses to supercomputers. ELBE uses graphics processing units (GPU) to accelerate the computations and can be used in a single GPU-equipped workstation of, e.g., a design engineer. The code has been successfully validated in very different fields, mostly related to naval architecture and mechanical engineering. In this contribution, we give an overview of past and present applications with practical relevance for civil engineers. The presented applications are grouped into three major categories: (i) tsunami simulations, considering wave propagation, wave runup, inundation and debris flows; (ii) dam break simulations; and (iii) numerical wave tanks for the calculation of hydrodynamic loads on fixed and moving bodies. This broad range of applications in combination with accurate numerical results and very competitive times to solution demonstrates that modern CFD tools in general, and the ELBE code in particular, can be a helpful design tool for civil and environmental engineers.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the effect of 3D lattice models (D3Q19 and D3Q27 lattices) on the simulation results of wall-bounded turbulent flows in a circular pipe and in a square duct. The LES with the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale (SGS) model was adopted for the turbulence simulation. To improve the credibility of our results on the lattice model effect, a comprehensive sensitivity study was performed of boundary treatment techniques and collision models, as well as grid sizes in the simulation of the turbulent pipe flows. Through the turbulent circular pipe flow simulation, it was discovered that the D3Q27 lattice model could achieve the rotational invariance in terms of long-time-averaged turbulence statistics and generated the results comparable to the DNS data, while the D3Q19 lattice model broke the rotational invariance and produced unreasonable data. In the turbulent square duct flow simulation, the rotational invariance was evaluated by comparing the results before and after rotating the geometry by 45° about a center. As in the circular pipe flow simulation, the D3Q19 lattice model could not achieve the rotational invariance while the D3Q27 lattice model could. The D3Q19 lattice model also produced poor results compared to those from the D3Q27 lattice model. These defects of the D3Q19 lattice model could be explained by the planes consisting of 2D lattices with five velocities (called defective planes in this study) in the D3Q19 lattice model, based on White and Chong’s [14] hypothesis. The defective planes had a deficiency in the momentum transfer of flow and turbulence, thus breaking the rotational invariance and causing the inaccurate results for tested problems.},

Monin–Obukhov (MO) similarity
within the near-ground region of near-neutral to moderately convective
atmospheric
boundary layers (ABL) from large-eddy simulation (LES) fields is reported
in this
work. High-resolution LES predictions of means, variances, budgets of turbulent
kinetic energy and temperature variance, and the velocity and temperature
spectra
from three ABL states
(−zi/L=0.44, 3 and 8) are
analysed
under MO scaling. The resolution in the near-ground region is increased
by using
‘nested meshes.’ For the close-to-neutral case
(−zi/L=0.44) the relative
roles of
grid resolution and subgrid-scale scale (SGS) parameterization on the
predictability of MO-similarity are also studied.
The simulated temperature field is found to satisfy the MO hypothesis and
agree well
with observations. The simulated velocity field, on the other hand, shows
significant
departures. Except for the horizontal variance, MO scales are the appropriate
normalizing scales for the near-ground-layer statistics. However, the LES
suggest
that the boundary layer depth zi has an
‘indirect’ influence on all near-ground-layer
variables except temperature, and the LES-predicted MO-scaled variables
exhibit a
functional dependence on both z/L and
z/zi. The simulated two-dimensional
spectra
of velocity and temperature fluctuations, however, suggest that while large
scales
deviate from MO-similarity, inertial subrange scales are MO-similar. Discrepancies
with field observations raise important questions of the non-dimensional
depth
z/zi
over which MO-similarity holds for a particular variable. Surface-layer
field studies
generally do not document zi.
It is also not clear to what extent these discrepancies are
due to approximations made in LES. Measurements are needed designed specifically
for comparing with LES predictions.},

  abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

The control area that will be focused on is the mechanical/aerodynamic part, which includes the wind turbines, their power production, fatigue and wakes affecting neighbouring wind turbines. The sub-objectives in this area of research are as follows: (i) maximizing the total wind farm power production; (ii) following a reference for the total wind farm active power; and (iii) doing this in a manner that minimizes fatigue loading for the wind turbines in the farm. Each of these sub-objectives is discussed, including the following important control issues: choice of input and output, control method and modelling used for controller design and simulation. The available literature from industry is also considered. Finally, a conclusion is presented discussing the established results, open challenges and necessary research.

  abstract = {Autopilot systems are typically composed of an “inner loop” providing stability and control, while an “outer loop” is responsible for mission-level objectives, e.g. way-point navigation. Autopilot systems for UAVs are predominately implemented using Proportional, Integral Derivative (PID) control systems, which have demonstrated exceptional performance in stable environments. However more sophisticated control is required to operate in unpredictable, and harsh environments. Intelligent flight control systems is an active area of research addressing limitations of PID control most recently through the use of reinforcement learning (RL) which has had success in other applications such as robotics. However previous work has focused primarily on using RL at the mission-level controller. In this work, we investigate the performance and accuracy of the inner control loop providing attitude control when using intelligent flight control systems trained with the state-of-theart RL algorithms, Deep Deterministic Gradient Policy (DDGP), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To investigate these unknowns we first developed an open-source high-fidelity simulation environment to train a flight controller attitude control of a quadrotor through RL. We then use our environment to compare their performance to that of a PID controller to identify if using RL is appropriate in high-precision, time-critical flight control.},

  abstract = {Flow noise during takeoff and landing of commercial aircrafts can be substantially reduced by the use of porous surface layers in suitable sections of wing profiles. On the other hand (passive) porosity and roughness of surfaces tend to have an adverse effect on the boundary layer and thus on the lift of wings. This results in the need to be able to predict the aerodynamic effects of porous segments of the surface by numerical methods for aerodynamic design of wings, taking into account porosity and roughness as a function of Reynolds number. The application of the RANS equations for this task requires additional modeling terms such as the permeability and the Kozeny–Carman parameter as well as the turbulent fluctuations of the velocity field to be determined by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) / Large Eddy Simulation (LES) simulations based on the lattice Boltzmann method which is the main focus of this contribution. For the simulation of the flow at the pore scale we use the cumulant lattice Boltzmann method. Due to the inherent requirements of resolving both the turbulence on the scale of an airfoil and the flow inside the pore scale resolved porous medium the resulting simulations require more than a billion grid nodes on a refined three-dimensional mesh leading to massively parallel simulations. We discuss modeling and computational aspects of our approach and present computational results including experimental validations.},

  abstract = {Industrial large-eddy simulation (LES), i.e. overnight runs with O(109) degrees of freedom (DOFs) and O(107) timesteps, has been one of the top priorities of CFD research over the last two decades. Current network and solver timings indicate that the required target of 5 ms/timestep is within reach: some cumulant Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) codes are reporting speeds in this range using multi-GPU systems, while some Finite Difference Method (FDM) codes running on traditional CPUs are achieving speeds that are only a factor of 2–4 slower. This implies that the long wait may be coming to a close. During the last three decades, a number of promising approaches have been tried. Given that the majority of these were promoted as the ‘solution to LES’ or the ‘solution to turbulence’, the paper lists them under the label of ‘the false prophecies’. Furthermore, some of the assumptions that are always part of the scientific discovery process turned out to be incorrect. These are listed under the term ’the false assumptions’. From an informal survey conducted in January of 2018, it appears that simple Cartesian Finite Difference codes or, equivalently, Lattice Boltzmann codes may be the first to achieve industrial LES.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) of a wind turbine under uniform inflow is performed using an actuator line model (ALM). Predictions from four LES research codes from the wind energy community are compared. The implementation of the ALM in all codes is similar and quantities along the blades are shown to match closely for all codes. The value of the Smagorinsky coefficient in the subgrid-scale turbulence model is shown to have a negligible effect on the time-averaged loads along the blades. Conversely, the breakdown location of the wake is strongly dependent on the Smagorinsky coefficient in uniform laminar inflow. Simulations are also performed using uniform mean velocity inflow with added homogeneous isotropic turbulence from a public database. The time-averaged loads along the blade do not depend on the inflow turbulence. Moreover, and in contrast to the uniform inflow cases, the Smagorinsky coefficient has a negligible effect on the wake profiles. It is concluded that for LES of wind turbines and wind farms using ALM, careful implementation and extensive cross-verification among codes can result in highly reproducible predictions. Moreover, the characteristics of the inflow turbulence appear to be more important than the details of the subgrid-scale modeling employed in the wake, at least for LES of wind energy applications at the resolutions tested in this work.},

  abstract = {Lifting line theory describes the cumulative effect of shed vorticity from finite span lifting surfaces. In this work, the theory is reformulated to improve the accuracy of the actuator line model (ALM). This model is a computational tool used to represent lifting surfaces, such as wind-turbine blades in computational fluid dynamics. In ALM, blade segments are represented by means of a Gaussian body force distribution with a prescribed kernel size. Prior analysis has shown that a representation of the blade using an optimal kernel width 

𝜖𝜖opt\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D716\}\^\{opt\}

 of approximately one quarter of the chord size results in accurate predictions of the velocity field and loads along the blades. Also, simulations have shown that use of the optimal kernel size yields accurate representation of the tip-vortex size and the associated downwash resulting in accurate predictions of the tip losses. In this work, we address the issue of how to represent the effects of finite span wings and tip vortices when using Gaussian body forces with a kernel size larger than the optimal value. This question is relevant in the context of coarse-scale large-eddy simulations that cannot afford the fine resolutions required to resolve the optimal kernel size. For this purpose, we present a filtered lifting line theory for a Gaussian force distribution. Based on the streamwise component of the vorticity transport equation, we develop an analytical model for the induced velocity resulting from the spanwise changes in lift force for an arbitrary kernel scale. The results are used to derive a subfilter-scale velocity model that is used to correct the velocity along the blade when using kernel sizes larger than 

𝜖𝜖opt\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D716\}\^\{opt\}

. Tests are performed in large-eddy simulation of flow over fixed wings with constant and elliptic chord distributions using various kernel sizes. Results show that by using the proposed subfilter velocity model, kernel-size independent predictions of lift coefficient and total lift forces agree with those obtained with the optimal kernel size.},

  abstract = {To study wind farm aerodynamics (WFA), the Wind Power industry currently relies on simple Engineering Models (EM) that simulate wind farms using basic principles of physics and empirically established approximations. EMs are fast and accurate for an overview of WFA and gauging mean power production, but cannot resolve phenomena like wake meandering, effect of atmospheric stratification on wake development, a turbine׳s response to partial wake interaction and yawed inflows etc., and their relation with turbine loading, which require a first principle physics-based model, namely Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Although advances in computer technology have promoted the application of CFD, the study of WFA is yet unworkable with Direct Numerical Simulation, which is the most comprehensive CFD technique. Thus, as a trade-off between cost and detail, researchers must resort to Large Eddy Simulation (LES) to garner thorough knowledge of WFA, which could in succession help the industry improve engineering models. This paper summarises the contributions of various LES investigations into WFA and how they have helped broaden our understanding of the subject. Additionally, the article touches upon the optimal use of LES and of the resultant data, and also the challenges faced by LES.},

In this paper we prove – theoretically and practically – that smearing the forces of the actuator line in the flow domain forms a viscous core in the bound and shed vorticity of the line. By combining a near-wake representation of the trailed vorticity with a viscous vortex core model, the missing induction from the smeared velocity is recovered. This novel dynamic smearing correction is verified for basic wing test cases and rotor simulations of a multimegawatt turbine. The latter cover the entire operational wind speed range as well as yaw, strong turbulence and pitch step cases. The correction is validated with lifting line simulations with and without viscous core, which are representative of an actuator line without and with smearing correction, respectively. The dynamic smearing correction makes the actuator line effectively act as a lifting line, as it was originally intended.},

  abstract = {In wind farms, wakes originating from upstream turbines cause reduced energy extraction and increased loading variability in downstream rows. The prospect of mitigating these detrimental effects through coordinated controllers at the wind-farm level has fueled a multitude of research efforts in wind-farm control. The main strategies in wind-farm control are to influence the velocity deficits in the wake by deviating from locally optimal axial induction setpoints on the one hand, and steering wakes away from downstream rows through yaw misalignment on the other hand. The current work investigates dynamic induction and yaw control of individual turbines for wind-farm power maximization in large-eddy simulations. To this end, receding-horizon optimal control techniques combined with continuous adjoint gradient evaluations are used. We study a 4 × 4 aligned wind farm, and find that for this farm layout yaw control is more effective than induction control, both for uniform and turbulent inflow conditions. Analysis of optimal yaw controls leads to the definition of two simplified yaw control strategies, in which wake meandering and wake redirection are exploited respectively. Furthermore it is found that dynamic yawing provides significant benefits over static yaw control in turbulent flow environments, whereas this is not the case for uniform inflow. Finally, the potential of combining overinductive axial induction control with yaw control is shown, with power gains that approximate the sum of those achieved by each control strategy separately.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Wake interactions between wind turbines in wind
farms lead to reduced energy extraction in downstream rows. In recent work,
optimization and large-eddy simulation were combined with the optimal dynamic
induction control of wind farms to study the mitigation of these effects,
showing potential power gains of up to 20\,\% (Munters and Meyers, 2017, Phil. Trans.
R. Soc. A, 375, 20160100, https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2016.010). However, the computational cost associated with
these optimal control simulations impedes the practical implementation of this
approach. Furthermore, the resulting control signals optimally react to the
specific instantaneous turbulent flow realizations in the simulations so
that they cannot be simply used in general. The current work focuses on the
detailed analysis of the optimization results of Munters and Meyers, with the
aim to identify simplified control strategies that mimic the optimal control
results and can be used in practice. The analysis shows that wind-farm
controls are optimized in a parabolic manner with little upstream propagation
of information. Moreover, turbines can be classified into first-row,
intermediate-row, and last-row turbines based on their optimal control
dynamics. At the moment, the control mechanisms for intermediate-row turbines
remain unclear, but for first-row turbines we find that the optimal controls
increase wake mixing through the periodic shedding of vortex rings. This behavior can
be mimicked with a simple sinusoidal thrust control strategy for first-row
turbines, resulting in robust power gains for turbines in the entrance region
of the farm.},

  abstract = {To analyse the sensitivity of blade geometry and airfoil characteristics on the prediction of performance characteristics of wind farms, large-eddy simulations using an actuator disc (ACD) method are performed for three different blade/airfoil configurations. The aim of the study is to determine how the mean characteristics of wake flow, mean power production and thrust depend on the choice of airfoil data and blade geometry. In order to simulate realistic conditions, pre-generated turbulence and wind shear are imposed in the computational domain. Using three different turbulence intensities and varying the spacing between the turbines, the flow around 4-8 aligned turbines is simulated. The analysis is based on normalized mean streamwise velocity, turbulence intensity, relative mean power production and thrust. From the computations it can be concluded that the actual airfoil characteristics and blade geometry only are of importance at very low inflow turbulence. At realistic turbulence conditions for an atmospheric boundary layer the specific blade characteristics play an minor role on power performance and the resulting wake characteristics. The results therefore give a hint that the choice of airfoil data in ACD simulations is not crucial if the intention of the simulations is to compute mean wake characteristics using a turbulent inflow.},

  abstract = {AbstractThe power production of the Lillgrund wind farm is determined numerically using large-eddy simulations and compared with measurements. In order to simulate realistic atmospheric conditions, pre-generated turbulence and wind shear are imposed in the computational domain. The atmospheric conditions are determined from data extracted from a met mast, which was erected prior to the establishment of the farm. In order to allocate most of the computational power to the simulations of the wake flow, the turbines are modeled using an actuator disc method where the discs are imposed in the computational domain as body forces which for every time step are calculated from tabulated airfoil data. A study of the influence of imposed upstream ambient turbulence is performed and shows that higher levels of turbulence results in slightly increased total power production and that it is of great importance to include ambient turbulence in the simulations. By introducing ambient atmospheric turbulence, the simulations compare very well with measurements at the studied inflow angles. A final study aiming at increasing the farm production by curtailing the power output of the front row turbines and thus letting more kinetic energy pass downstream is performed. The results, however, show that manipulating only the front row turbines has no positive effect on the farm production, and therefore, more complex curtailment strategies are needed to be tested.

The focus is on the trailed vorticity model, which is based on the near wake model (NWM) by Beddoes and has been extended to include the effects of downwind convection and to enable a faster and more accurate computation of the induction, especially close to the blade root and tip. The NWM is introduced to model the detailed steady and unsteady induction from the first part of the trailed vorticity behind the individual rotor blades. The model adds a radial coupling between the blade sections and provides a computation of tip loss effects that depends on the actual blade geometry and the respective operating point. Moreover, the coupling of the NWM with a BEM theory-based far wake model is presented. To avoid accounting for the near wake induction twice, the induction from the BEM model is reduced by a coupling factor, which is continuously updated during the computation to ensure a good behavior of the model in varying operating conditions. The coupled near and far wake model is compared with a simple prescribed wake lifting line model, a BEM model and full rotor computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate the steady-state results in different cases. The model is shown to deliver good results across the whole operation range of the NREL 5-MW reference wind turbine. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The model is validated against analytical results for an elliptical wing in constant inflow and against stand still measurements from the NREL/NASA Phase VI unsteady experiment. The extended model obtains good results in case of the elliptical wing, but underpredicts the steady loading for the Phase VI blade in attached flow. The prediction of the dynamic force coefficient loops from the Phase VI experiment is improved by the trailed vorticity modeling in both attached flow and stall in most cases. The exception is the tangential force coefficient in stall, where the codes and measurements deviate and no clear improvement is visible.},

Fluid Mech. 865, 281–302 (2019)]. However, while promising results were obtained on a simple 2-dimensional benchmark flow at a moderate Reynolds number, considerable speedups will be required to investigate more challenging flow configurations. In the case of DRL trained with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, it was found that the CFD part, rather than training the artificial neural network, was the limiting factor for speed of execution. Therefore, speedups should be obtained through a combination of two approaches. The first one, which is well documented in the literature, is to parallelize the numerical simulation itself. The second one is to adapt the DRL algorithm for parallelization. Here, a simple strategy is to use several independent simulations running in parallel to collect experiences faster. In the present work, we discuss this solution for parallelization. We illustrate that perfect speedups can be obtained up to the batch size of the DRL agent, and slightly suboptimal scaling still takes place for an even larger number of simulations. This is, therefore, an important step toward enabling the study of more sophisticated fluid mechanics problems through DRL.},

While it will take time to fully grasp the potentialities as well as the limitations of these methods, evidence is starting to accumulate that point to their potential in helping solve problems for which no theoretically optimal solution method is known. This is particularly true in fluid mechanics, where problems involving optimal control and optimal design are involved. Indeed, such problems are famously difficult to solve effectively with traditional methods due to the combination of non linearity, non convexity, and high dimensionality they involve. By contrast, deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a method of optimization based on teaching empirical strategies to an ANN through trial and error, is well adapted to solving such problems. In this short review, we offer an insight into the current state of the art of the use of DRL within fluid mechanics, focusing on control and optimal design problems.},

This state-space model is coupled with a multi-stage utility function that quantifies the power to be maximized. The benefits of this approach include: a simple algorithm to determine the turbine optimal controls, as a feedback function of the wind farm state, and a rigorous, yet simple, method to calculate the limit of performance for wind farm power maximization. A one-dimensional cascade of wind turbines is used to illustrate the approach. Also given is an analytical expression for the maximum power that can be extracted from the one-dimensional cascade, which parallels the well-known Betz limit for a single turbine.},

  abstract = {The prospects of active wake deflection control to mitigate wake-induced power losses in wind farms have been demonstrated by large eddy simulations, wind tunnel experiments and recent field tests. However, it has not yet been fully understood how the yaw control of wind farms should take into account the variability of current environmental conditions in the field and the uncertainty of their measurements. This research investigated the influence of dynamic wind direction changes 5 on active wake deflection by intended yaw misalignment. For this purpose the wake model FLORIS was used together with wind direction measurements recorded at an onshore met mast in flat terrain. The analysis showed that active wake deflection has a high sensitivity towards short-term wind directional changes. This can lead to an increased yaw activity of the turbines. Fluctuations and uncertainties can cause the attempt to increase the power output to fail. Therefore a methodology to optimise the yaw control algorithm for active wake deflection was introduced, which considers dynamic wind direction changes and 10 inaccuracies in the determination of the wind direction. The evaluation based on real wind direction time series confirmed that the robust control algorithm can be tailored to specific meteorological and wind farm conditions and that it can indeed achieve an overall power increase in realistic inflow conditions. Furthermore recommendations for the implementation are given which could combine the robust behaviour with reduced yaw activity.},

  abstract = {For several decades, engineers of different fields deal with flow problems. Due to large scales and velocities in the special field of civil engineering, this is generally a matter of transient or turbulent flows. Unfortunately, time-dependent simulations are computationally intensive by nature. Typically large “High Performance Computing” (HPC) cluster were used for the computation of such simulations. However, the simulations require several days or weeks for the computations. HPC clusters are generally not available for small and medium engineering companies. The implementation of suitable alternatives were required to provide equivalent prospects to such companies. More precisely, our aim is the possibility to execute large time-dependent flow simulations on affordable desktop systems. The first part gives an introduction to the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), that relies on cartesian grids. Here we focus on the cumulant lattice Boltzmann model and its advantages compared to traditional LBM models. In addition we present developments relating to alternative hardware systems. This implementation is not only suitable for the execution on central processing units (CPUs), but particular optimized for the execution on general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). The second part focuses on fundamental algorithmic and numerical optimizations. Hence we present the “Esoteric Twist” method that was developed at our institute, and potentially saves half of the required memory for our computations. Afterwards the implementation of an indirect addressing scheme, that saves an additional amount of memory, for example in porous media, is described. Besides the lower memory consumption, the indirect addressing provides high flexibility relating to the possible test cases, which depicts a crucial factor to solve realistic flow problems. Most test cases comprise areas of higher and areas of lower interest. Generally the areas of major interest should be discretized with a maximum resolution, while such resolution results in a waste of memory and computational work in areas of lower interest. We realized this demand with the implementation of a grid refinement method for the cartesian LBM grids. The description of a multi-GPGPU solution completes the second part. In the third part, several numerical validation tests are presented. The fourth part concludes with the consideration of real world flow problems.},

The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD(λ). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks.},

Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

  abstract = {The application of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) in three-dimensional isothermal hydrodynamic problems often adopts one of the following models: D3Q15, D3Q19, or D3Q27. Although all of them retrieve consistent Navier–Stokes dynamics in the continuum limit, they are expected to behave differently at discrete level. The present work addresses this issue by performing a LBM truncation error analysis. As a conclusion, it is theoretically demonstrated that differences among the aforementioned cubic lattices lie in the structure of their non-linear truncation errors. While reduced lattice schemes, such as D3Q15 and D3Q19, introduce spurious angular dependencies through non-linear truncation errors, the complete three-dimensional cubic lattice D3Q27 is absent from such features. This result justifies the superiority of the D3Q27 lattice scheme to cope with the rotational invariance principle in three-dimensional isothermal hydrodynamic problems, particularly when convection is not negligible. Such a theoretical conclusion also finds support in numerical tests presented in this work: a Poiseuille duct flow and a weakly-rotating duct flow.},

Computers can beat humans at increasingly complex games, including chess and Go. However, these programs are typically constructed for a particular game, exploiting its properties, such as the symmetries of the board on which it is played. Silver et al. developed a program called AlphaZero, which taught itself to play Go, chess, and shogi (a Japanese version of chess) (see the Editorial, and the Perspective by Campbell). AlphaZero managed to beat state-of-the-art programs specializing in these three games. The ability of AlphaZero to adapt to various game rules is a notable step toward achieving a general game-playing system.

The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.

  abstract = {Fish in schooling formations navigate complex flow fields replete with mechanical energy in the vortex wakes of their companions. Their schooling behavior has been associated with evolutionary advantages including energy savings, yet the underlying physical mechanisms remain unknown. We show that fish can improve their sustained propulsive efficiency by placing themselves in appropriate locations in the wake of other swimmers and intercepting judiciously their shed vortices. This swimming strategy leads to collective energy savings and is revealed through a combination of high-fidelity flow simulations with a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The RL algorithm relies on a policy defined by deep, recurrent neural nets, with long–short-term memory cells, that are essential for capturing the unsteadiness of the two-way interactions between the fish and the vortical flow field. Surprisingly, we find that swimming in-line with a leader is not associated with energetic benefits for the follower. Instead, “smart swimmer(s)” place themselves at off-center positions, with respect to the axis of the leader(s) and deform their body to synchronize with the momentum of the oncoming vortices, thus enhancing their swimming efficiency at no cost to the leader(s). The results confirm that fish may harvest energy deposited in vortices and support the conjecture that swimming in formation is energetically advantageous. Moreover, this study demonstrates that deep RL can produce navigation algorithms for complex unsteady and vortical flow fields, with promising implications for energy savings in autonomous robotic swarms.},

  abstract = {The aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbine wakes is studied. The contents is directed towards the physics of power extraction by wind turbines and reviews both the near and the far wake region. For the near wake, the survey is restricted to uniform, steady and parallel flow conditions, thereby excluding wind shear, wind speed and rotor setting changes and yawed conditions. The emphasis is put on measurements in controlled conditions. For the far wake, the survey focusses on both single turbines and wind farm effects, and the experimental and numerical work are reviewed; the main interest is to study how the far wake decays downstream, in order to estimate the effect produced in downstream turbines. The article is further restricted to horizontal axis wind turbines and excludes all other types of turbines.},

  abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently spread into a range of domains within physics and engineering, with multiple remarkable achievements. Still, much remains to be explored before the capabilities of these methods are well understood. In this paper, we present the first application of DRL to direct shape optimization. We show that, given adequate reward, an artificial neural network trained through DRL is able to generate optimal shapes on its own, without any prior knowledge and in a constrained time. While we choose here to apply this methodology to aerodynamics, the optimization process itself is agnostic to details of the use case, and thus our work paves the way to new generic shape optimization strategies both in fluid mechanics, and more generally in any domain where a relevant reward function can be defined.},

  abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method has recently gained popularity as a tool for simulating complex fluid flows. It uses discrete sets of velocity vectors, or lattices, to create a reduced model of the molecular dynamics of a continuum fluid. While several lattices are believed to behave isotropically, there are reports of qualitatively incorrect results. However, thus far, the reason as to why a lack of isotropy occurs is not known. Based on the hypothesis that lower order lattices may not display rotational invariance, this study tests the isotropy of the D3Q15, D3Q19 and D3Q27 lattices by performing simulations at intermediate Reynolds numbers (50–500) and low Knudsen number ({$<$}0.0005) in an axisymmetrical geometry with a nozzle leading to a throat followed by a sudden expansion. The symmetry properties of the results were examined. It was found that at Re⩾250 the D3Q15 and D3Q19 lattices produced different results depending on the plane of the lattice with which the flow was aligned. Lattice planes with fewer than six velocity vectors consistently produced results which were qualitatively different from the planes with six or more velocity vectors. These errors were not observed at Re = 50 or when a D3Q27 lattice was used. They appeared to be independent of grid density, collision operator and Ma. This suggests that the lattices which contain these planes are not fully isotropic and therefore do not properly replicate the behavior of a real fluid in this particular situation, notably downstream from the expansion. Predictions made using these models in more complex geometries may therefore be affected by the orientation of the lattice. When using LBM in CFD simulation (including validation) this study highlights the need for caution to ensure that the solution obtained is independent of the lattice orientation throughout the domain.},

  abstract = {This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},
