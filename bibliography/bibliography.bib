	abstract = {We present the first application of an Artificial Neural Network trained through a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent to perform active flow control. It is shown that, in a 2D simulation of the Karman vortex street at moderate Reynolds number (Re = 100), our Artificial Neural Network is able to learn an active control strategy from experimenting with the mass flow rates of two jets on the sides of a cylinder. By interacting with the unsteady wake, the Artificial Neural Network successfully stabilizes the vortex alley and reduces drag by about 8\%. This is performed while using small mass flow rates for the actuation, on the order of 0.5\% of the mass flow rate intersecting the cylinder cross section once a new pseudo-periodic shedding regime is found. This opens the way to a new class of methods for performing active flow control.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.5116415},
	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has recently been proposed as a methodology to discover complex Active Flow Control (AFC) strategies [Rabault, J., Kuchta, M., Jensen, A., Reglade, U., \& Cerardi, N. (2019): "Artificial neural networks trained through deep reinforcement learning discover control strategies for active flow control", Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 865, 281-302]. However, while promising results were obtained on a simple 2D benchmark flow at a moderate Reynolds number, considerable speedups will be required to investigate more challenging flow configurations. In the case of DRL trained with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, it was found that the CFD part, rather than training the Artificial Neural Network, was the limiting factor for speed of execution. Therefore, speedups should be obtained through a combination of two approaches. The first one, which is well documented in the literature, is to parallelize the numerical simulation itself. The second one is to adapt the DRL algorithm for parallelization. Here, a simple strategy is to use several independent simulations running in parallel to collect experiences faster. In the present work, we discuss this solution for parallelization. We illustrate that perfect speedups can be obtained up to the batch size of the DRL agent, and slightly suboptimal scaling still takes place for an even larger number of simulations. This is, therefore, an important step towards enabling the study of more sophisticated Fluid Mechanics problems through DRL.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efﬁcient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the inﬁnity norm.},

We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks.},

	abstract = {Autopilot systems are typically composed of an “inner loop” providing stability and control, while an “outer loop” is responsible for mission-level objectives, e.g. way-point navigation. Autopilot systems for UAVs are predominately implemented using Proportional, Integral Derivative (PID) control systems, which have demonstrated exceptional performance in stable environments. However more sophisticated control is required to operate in unpredictable, and harsh environments. Intelligent ﬂight control systems is an active area of research addressing limitations of PID control most recently through the use of reinforcement learning (RL) which has had success in other applications such as robotics. However previous work has focused primarily on using RL at the mission-level controller. In this work, we investigate the performance and accuracy of the inner control loop providing attitude control when using intelligent ﬂight control systems trained with the state-of-theart RL algorithms, Deep Deterministic Gradient Policy (DDGP), Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To investigate these unknowns we ﬁrst developed an open-source high-ﬁdelity simulation environment to train a ﬂight controller attitude control of a quadrotor through RL. We then use our environment to compare their performance to that of a PID controller to identify if using RL is appropriate in high-precision, time-critical ﬂight control.},

	abstract = {An optimal feedback controller for a given Markov decision process (MDP) can in principle be synthesized by value or policy iteration. However, if the system dynamics and the reward function are unknown, a learning agent must discover an optimal controller via direct interaction with the environment. Such interactive data gathering commonly leads to divergence towards dangerous or uninformative regions of the state space unless additional regularization measures are taken. Prior works proposed bounding the information loss measured by the Kullback\&ndash;Leibler (KL) divergence at every policy improvement step to eliminate instability in the learning dynamics. In this paper, we consider a broader family of f-divergences, and more concretely    \&alpha;   -divergences, which inherit the beneficial property of providing the policy improvement step in closed form at the same time yielding a corresponding dual objective for policy evaluation. Such entropic proximal policy optimization view gives a unified perspective on compatible actor-critic architectures. In particular, common least-squares value function estimation coupled with advantage-weighted maximum likelihood policy improvement is shown to correspond to the Pearson     \&chi; 2    -divergence penalty. Other actor-critic pairs arise for various choices of the penalty-generating function f. On a concrete instantiation of our framework with the    \&alpha;   -divergence, we carry out asymptotic analysis of the solutions for different values of    \&alpha;    and demonstrate the effects of the divergence function choice on common standard reinforcement learning problems.},

Current network and solver timings indicate that the required target of 5 ms/timestep is within reach: some cumulant Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) codes are reporting speeds in this range using multi-GPU systems, while some Finite Difference Method (FDM) codes running on traditional CPUs are achieving speeds that are only a factor of 2–4 slower. This implies that the long wait may be coming to a close. During the last three decades, a number of promising approaches have been tried. Given that the majority of these were promoted as the ‘solution to LES’ or the ‘solution to turbulence’, the paper lists them under the label of ‘the false prophecies’. Furthermore, some of the assumptions that are always part of the scientific discovery process turned out to be incorrect. These are listed under the term ’the false assumptions’. From an informal survey conducted in January of 2018, it appears that simple Cartesian Finite Difference codes or, equivalently, Lattice Boltzmann codes may be the first to achieve industrial LES.},

Their schooling behavior has been associated with evolutionary advantages including energy savings, yet the underlying physical mechanisms remain unknown. We show that fish can improve their sustained propulsive efficiency by placing themselves in appropriate locations in the wake of other swimmers and intercepting judiciously their shed vortices. This swimming strategy leads to collective energy savings and is revealed through a combination of high-fidelity flow simulations with a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The RL algorithm relies on a policy defined by deep, recurrent neural nets, with long–short-term memory cells, that are essential for capturing the unsteadiness of the two-way interactions between the fish and the vortical flow field. Surprisingly, we find that swimming in-line with a leader is not associated with energetic benefits for the follower. Instead, “smart swimmer(s)” place themselves at off-center positions, with respect to the axis of the leader(s) and deform their body to synchronize with the momentum of the oncoming vortices, thus enhancing their swimming efficiency at no cost to the leader(s). The results confirm that fish may harvest energy deposited in vortices and support the conjecture that swimming in formation is energetically advantageous. Moreover, this study demonstrates that deep RL can produce navigation algorithms for complex unsteady and vortical flow fields, with promising implications for energy savings in autonomous robotic swarms.},

The wind turbine is represented by the actuator line model (ALM) that is implemented in a GPU-accelerated (Graphics Processing Unit) lattice Boltzmann framework. The implementation is validated and discussed by means of a code-to-code comparison to an established finite-volume Navier-Stokes solver. To this end, the ALM is subjected to a uniform laminar inflow while a standard Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model is employed in both numerical approaches. The comparison shows a good agreement in terms of the blade loads and near-wake characteristics. The main differences are found in the point of laminar-turbulent transition of the wake and the resulting far-wake. In line with other studies these differences can be attributed to the different orders of accuracy of the two methods. In a second part the possibilities of implicit LES with the CLBM are investigated using a limiter applied to the third-order cumulants in the scheme's collision operator. The study shows that the limiter generally ensures numerical stability. Nevertheless, a universal tuning approach for the limiter appears to be required, especially for perturbation-sensitive transition studies. In summary, the range of discussed cases outline the general feasibility of wind turbine simulations using the CLBM. In addition, it highlights the potential of GPU-accelerated LBM implementations to significantly speed up LES in the field of wind energy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Using the structure of a recursive asymptotic analysis we derive conditions on cumulants that guarantee a prescribed order of Galilean invariance for lattice Boltzmann models. We then apply these conditions to three different lattice Boltzmann models and obtain three models with fourth order accurate advection. One of the models uses 27 speeds on a body centered cubic lattice, one uses 33 speeds on an extended Cartesian lattice and one uses 27 speeds plus three finite differences on a Cartesian lattice. All models offer too few degrees of freedom to impose the conditions on the cumulants directly. However, the specific aliasing structure of these lattices permit fourth order accuracy for a model specific optimal reference temperature. Our theoretical derivations are confirmed by measuring the phase lag of traveling vortexes and shear waves.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations of the flow past an array of three aligned turbines have been performed. The study is focused on below rated (Region 2) wind speeds. The turbines are controlled through the generator torque gain, as usually done in Region 2. Two operating strategies are considered: (i) preset individual optimum torque gain based on a model for the power coefficient (baseline case) and (ii) real-time optimization of torque gain for maximizing each individual turbine power capture during operation. The real-time optimization is carried out through a model-free approach, namely, extremum-seeking control. It is shown that ESC is capable of increasing the power production of the array by 6.5\% relative to the baseline case. The extremum-seeking control reduces the torque gain of the downstream turbines, thus increasing the angular speed of the blades. This results in improved aerodynamics near the tip of the blade that is the portion contributing mostly to the torque and power. In addition, an increase in angular speed leads to a larger entrainment in the wake, which also contributes to provide additional available power downstream. It is also shown that the tip speed ratio may not be a reliable performance indicator when the turbines are in waked conditions. This may be a concern when using optimal parameter settings, determined from isolated turbine models, in applications with waked turbines. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Instabilities arise in a number of flow configurations. One such manifestation is the development of interfacial waves in multiphase flows, such as those observed in the falling liquid film problem. Controlling the development of such instabilities is a problem of both academic interest and industrial interest. However, this has proven challenging in most cases due to the strong nonlinearity and high dimensionality of the underlying equations. In the present work, we successfully apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for the control of the one-dimensional depth-integrated falling liquid film. In addition, we introduce for the first time translational invariance in the architecture of the DRL agent, and we exploit locality of the control problem to define a dense reward function. This allows us to both speed up learning considerably and easily control an arbitrary large number of jets and overcome the curse of dimensionality on the control output size that would take place using a naïve approach. This illustrates the importance of the architecture of the agent for successful DRL control, and we believe this will be an important element in the effective application of DRL to large two-dimensional or three-dimensional systems featuring translational, axisymmetric, or other invariance.},

In this work, we conduct a detailed review of existing DRL applications to fluid mechanics problems. In addition, we present recent results that further illustrate the potential of DRL in Fluid Mechanics. The coupling methods used in each case are covered, detailing their advantages and limitations. Our review also focuses on the comparison with classical methods for optimal control and optimization. Finally, several test cases are described that illustrate recent progress made in this field. The goal of this publication is to provide an understanding of DRL capabilities along with state-of-the-art applications in fluid dynamics to researchers wishing to address new problems with these methods.},

The results are then compared to corresponding LES data for various shear conditions. From this, a model for the TI distribution across a rotor disc is devised and calibrated. In addition, a second simpler version of the model is derived by assuming a power law for the velocity profile. The models are related to the Mann model and shown to have a similar scaling, however they are simpler and based on assumptions for turbulent boundary layers rather than homogeneous turbulence. The models are then tested for a range of stability conditions and shear values of the ABL including waked conditions from upstream wind turbines that stretch the assumptions made.},

	abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is known to suffer from stability issues when the collision model relies on the BGK approximation, especially in the zero viscosity limit and for non-vanishing Mach numbers. To tackle this problem, two kinds of solutions were proposed in the literature. They consist in changing either the numerical discretization (finite-volume, finite-difference, spectral-element, etc) of the discrete velocity Boltzmann equation (DVBE), or the collision model. In this work, the latter solution is investigated in details. More precisely, we propose a comprehensive comparison of (static relaxation time based) collision models, in terms of stability, and with preliminary results on their accuracy, for the simulation of isothermal high-Reynolds number flows in the (weakly) compressible regime. It starts by investigating the possible impact of collision models on the macroscopic behavior of stream-and-collide based D2Q9-LBMs, which clarifies the exact physical properties of collision models on LBMs. It is followed by extensive linear and numerical stability analyses, supplemented with an accuracy study based on the transport of vortical structures over long distances. In order to draw conclusions as general as possible, the most common moment spaces (raw, central, Hermite, central Hermite and cumulant), as well as regularized approaches, are considered for the comparative studies. LBMs based on dynamic collision mechanisms (entropic collision, subgrid scale models, explicit filtering, etc) are also briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {The control of complex systems is of critical importance in many branches of science, engineering, and industry. Controlling an unsteady ﬂuid ﬂow is particularly important, as ﬂow control is a key enabler for technologies in energy (e.g., wind, tidal, and combustion), transportation (e.g., planes, trains, and automobiles), security (e.g., tracking airborne contamination), and health (e.g., artiﬁcial hearts and artiﬁcial respiration). However, the high-dimensional, nonlinear, and multiscale dynamics make real-time feedback control infeasible. Fortunately, these high-dimensional systems exhibit dominant, low-dimensional patterns of activity that can be exploited for effective control in the sense that knowledge of the entire state of a system is not required. Advances in machine learning have the potential to revolutionize ﬂow control given its ability to extract principled, low-rank feature spaces characterizing such complex systems. We present a novel deep learning model predictive control (DeepMPC) framework that exploits low-rank features of the ﬂow in order to achieve considerable improvements to control performance. Instead of predicting the entire ﬂuid state, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately predict the control relevant quantities of the system. The RNN is then embedded into a MPC framework to construct a feedback loop, and incoming sensor data is used to perform online updates to improve prediction accuracy.

sentence selection, and sentence topic prediction. Results from experiments run
on two corpora, English documents in Wikipedia and a subset of articles from a
recent snapshot of English Google News, indicate that using both words and
topics as features improves performance of the CLSTM models over baseline LSTM
models for these tasks. For example on the next sentence selection task, we get
relative accuracy improvements of 21\% for the Wikipedia dataset and 18\% for the
Google News dataset. This clearly demonstrates the significant benefit of using
context appropriately in natural language (NL) tasks. This has implications for
a wide variety of NL applications like question answering, sentence completion,

	abstract = {Flow noise during takeoff and landing of commercial aircrafts can be substantially reduced by the use of porous surface layers in suitable sections of wing profiles. On the other hand (passive) porosity and roughness of surfaces tend to have an adverse effect on the boundary layer and thus on the lift of wings. This results in the need to be able to predict the aerodynamic effects of porous segments of the surface by numerical methods for aerodynamic design of wings, taking into account porosity and roughness as a function of Reynolds number. The application of the RANS equations for this task requires additional modeling terms such as the permeability and the Kozeny–Carman parameter as well as the turbulent fluctuations of the velocity field to be determined by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) / Large Eddy Simulation (LES) simulations based on the lattice Boltzmann method which is the main focus of this contribution. For the simulation of the flow at the pore scale we use the cumulant lattice Boltzmann method. Due to the inherent requirements of resolving both the turbulence on the scale of an airfoil and the flow inside the pore scale resolved porous medium the resulting simulations require more than a billion grid nodes on a refined three-dimensional mesh leading to massively parallel simulations. We discuss modeling and computational aspects of our approach and present computational results including experimental validations.},

The intermediate values of drag in a small range of Reynolds numbers around the drag crisis observed in averaged data sets are found to originate from the flow switching between the high and the low drag conditions. Around the critical Reynolds number, the time spent in the low drag condition increases with the Reynolds number such that the average drag curve has a finite steepness.},

	url = {http://www.digibib.tu-bs.de/?docid=00062945},
	abstract = {For several decades, engineers of different fields deal with flow problems. Due to large scales and velocities in the special field of civil engineering, this is generally a matter of transient or turbulent flows. Unfortunately, time-dependent simulations are computationally intensive by nature. Typically large “High Performance Computing” (HPC) cluster were used for the computation of such simulations. However, the simulations require several days or weeks for the computations. HPC clusters are generally not available for small and medium engineering companies. The implementation of suitable alternatives were required to provide equivalent prospects to such companies. More precisely, our aim is the possibility to execute large time-dependent flow simulations on affordable desktop systems. The first part gives an introduction to the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), that relies on cartesian grids. Here we focus on the cumulant lattice Boltzmann model and its advantages compared to traditional LBM models. In addition we present developments relating to alternative hardware systems. This implementation is not only suitable for the execution on central processing units (CPUs), but particular optimized for the execution on general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs). The second part focuses on fundamental algorithmic and numerical optimizations. Hence we present the “Esoteric Twist” method that was developed at our institute, and potentially saves half of the required memory for our computations. Afterwards the implementation of an indirect addressing scheme, that saves an additional amount of memory, for example in porous media, is described. Besides the lower memory consumption, the indirect addressing provides high flexibility relating to the possible test cases, which depicts a crucial factor to solve realistic flow problems. Most test cases comprise areas of higher and areas of lower interest. Generally the areas of major interest should be discretized with a maximum resolution, while such resolution results in a waste of memory and computational work in areas of lower interest. We realized this demand with the implementation of a grid refinement method for the cartesian LBM grids. The description of a multi-GPGPU solution completes the second part. In the third part, several numerical validation tests are presented. The fourth part concludes with the consideration of real world flow problems.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the effect of 3D lattice models (D3Q19 and D3Q27 lattices) on the simulation results of wall-bounded turbulent flows in a circular pipe and in a square duct. The LES with the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale (SGS) model was adopted for the turbulence simulation. To improve the credibility of our results on the lattice model effect, a comprehensive sensitivity study was performed of boundary treatment techniques and collision models, as well as grid sizes in the simulation of the turbulent pipe flows. Through the turbulent circular pipe flow simulation, it was discovered that the D3Q27 lattice model could achieve the rotational invariance in terms of long-time-averaged turbulence statistics and generated the results comparable to the DNS data, while the D3Q19 lattice model broke the rotational invariance and produced unreasonable data. In the turbulent square duct flow simulation, the rotational invariance was evaluated by comparing the results before and after rotating the geometry by 45° about a center. As in the circular pipe flow simulation, the D3Q19 lattice model could not achieve the rotational invariance while the D3Q27 lattice model could. The D3Q19 lattice model also produced poor results compared to those from the D3Q27 lattice model. These defects of the D3Q19 lattice model could be explained by the planes consisting of 2D lattices with five velocities (called defective planes in this study) in the D3Q19 lattice model, based on White and Chong’s [14] hypothesis. The defective planes had a deficiency in the momentum transfer of flow and turbulence, thus breaking the rotational invariance and causing the inaccurate results for tested problems.},

	abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method has recently gained popularity as a tool for simulating complex fluid flows. It uses discrete sets of velocity vectors, or lattices, to create a reduced model of the molecular dynamics of a continuum fluid. While several lattices are believed to behave isotropically, there are reports of qualitatively incorrect results. However, thus far, the reason as to why a lack of isotropy occurs is not known. Based on the hypothesis that lower order lattices may not display rotational invariance, this study tests the isotropy of the D3Q15, D3Q19 and D3Q27 lattices by performing simulations at intermediate Reynolds numbers (50–500) and low Knudsen number ({\textless}0.0005) in an axisymmetrical geometry with a nozzle leading to a throat followed by a sudden expansion. The symmetry properties of the results were examined. It was found that at Re⩾250 the D3Q15 and D3Q19 lattices produced different results depending on the plane of the lattice with which the flow was aligned. Lattice planes with fewer than six velocity vectors consistently produced results which were qualitatively different from the planes with six or more velocity vectors. These errors were not observed at Re = 50 or when a D3Q27 lattice was used. They appeared to be independent of grid density, collision operator and Ma. This suggests that the lattices which contain these planes are not fully isotropic and therefore do not properly replicate the behavior of a real fluid in this particular situation, notably downstream from the expansion. Predictions made using these models in more complex geometries may therefore be affected by the orientation of the lattice. When using LBM in CFD simulation (including validation) this study highlights the need for caution to ensure that the solution obtained is independent of the lattice orientation throughout the domain.},

Although all of them retrieve consistent Navier–Stokes dynamics in the continuum limit, they are expected to behave differently at discrete level. The present work addresses this issue by performing a LBM truncation error analysis. As a conclusion, it is theoretically demonstrated that differences among the aforementioned cubic lattices lie in the structure of their non-linear truncation errors. While reduced lattice schemes, such as D3Q15 and D3Q19, introduce spurious angular dependencies through non-linear truncation errors, the complete three-dimensional cubic lattice D3Q27 is absent from such features. This result justifies the superiority of the D3Q27 lattice scheme to cope with the rotational invariance principle in three-dimensional isothermal hydrodynamic problems, particularly when convection is not negligible. Such a theoretical conclusion also finds support in numerical tests presented in this work: a Poiseuille duct flow and a weakly-rotating duct flow.},
